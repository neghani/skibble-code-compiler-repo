<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>
  In this example, we have created a box with a width of 200px, height of 100px,
  padding of 20px, border of 1px solid black, and margin of 20px. The total
  width of the box would be calculated as follows:
</p>
<pre>
total width = width + 2 * (padding + border + margin)
</pre>

<p>So in this case, the total width would be:</p>
<pre>
total width = 200px + 2 * (20px + 1px + 20px) = 282px
</pre>

<p>
  This means that the box will take up a total of 282 pixels in width, including
  its padding, border, and margin. The same calculation applies to the height of
  the box.

<p>
  Understanding the box model is important for designing and laying out web
  pages, as it determines how elements are positioned and how much space they
  take up on the page.
